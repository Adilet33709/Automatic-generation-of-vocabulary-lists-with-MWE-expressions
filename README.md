## Automatic Generation of Vocabulary Lists with Multiword Expressions
This repository contains code and automatically generated vocabulary list presented in our paper "Automatic Generation of Vocabulary Lists with Multiword Expressions". The paper will be presented in MWE 2023 Workshop. 
Specifically, the Code folder has two parts. The first part contains codes to evaluate a vocabulary list in terms of study time, text comprehension metrics introduced in our paper. The second part contains code to automatically generate vocabulary list with MWEs.
